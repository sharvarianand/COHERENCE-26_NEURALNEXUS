/**
 * Generate an email subject and HTML body from a single natural-language prompt.
 *
 * @param prompt  - The campaign author's intent, e.g. "Announce our strawberry promo with humour".
 * @param lead    - When provided the AI personifies the email for that specific lead.
 *                  When null the AI uses {{name}}, {{company}}, {{industry}} as literal
 *                  placeholders so one template can be substituted for every lead.
 * @param productDescription - Optional product context injected into the system prompt.
 * @param options.senderEmail - The From address; injected so the AI never writes [Your Name].
 * @param options.isFollowUp  - When true, instructs the AI this is a follow-up, not a cold intro.
